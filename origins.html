            <h2>A Scientific Tragedy</h2>
            <p>
                It is said that Wiener Man is the result of a secret biological experiment gone wrong. In 1992, Mutant Biophysicist Fred Brooks
                gazed upon his hotdog lunch and took pity upon it's lack of arms, eyes, and sentience. He combined a secret formula of
                gaterade and poor-over coffee and dipped the hotdog in it for 41 days. On the 42nd day, out came
                Wiener Man, a living bipedal hotdog. However, the formula was not perfect, and Wiener Man was born with the
                insatiable desire to eat himself. Fred Brooks could not bare to see his glorious creation taken away so quickly, so he shot Wiener Man
                with a stasis beam. Now, he is forever applying mustard to his face, barely on the edge of engulfing himself alive for eternity.

                However, it is said that Wiener Man can break out of stasis once a year on the full moon, when he walks the world in search of hotdogs to eat,
                barely resisting the urge to eat himself instead.
